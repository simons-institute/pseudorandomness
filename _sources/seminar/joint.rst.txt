Joint MSRI/SI Seminar
=====================

The joint MSRI/SI seminar will be Thursdays, 4:30-5:30.
It will alternate between 116 and MSRI (room TBA) starting at MSRI. 
Co-ordinators are `Thomas Bloom <https://people.maths.bris.ac.uk/~matfb/index.html>`_
and `James Maynard <http://www.magd.ox.ac.uk/member-of-staff/james-maynard/>`_.  
A tradition started of nominating other people to talk, so if you want someone
else to talk at this seminar about something you'd like to learn,
tell the co-ordinators the topic you want to hear about.
