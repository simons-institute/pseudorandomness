Pseudorandomness Seminar
========================

The main Pseudorandomness Seminar will be Tuesdays, 4:30-5:30 in room 116 of
Calvin Lab.
We will adjourn to a pub of some kind afterwards.
The co-ordinators are `Marco Carmosino <http://marco.ntime.org/>`_ and
`Jarrod Millman <http://www.jarrodmillman.com/>`_.

Call for Talks
--------------

If you would like one of these slots, please send a request and title to Marco
or Jarrod.
Please make sure to specify whether you would like a regular or lightning talk.
If no one contacts them, they will contact you!  

Talks
~~~~~

We are soliciting one 45 minute talk each week.

Lightning Talks
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

We are soliciting two "lightning talks" per week.
These slots will be limited to five minutes, but otherwise quite informal.
Use them to announce work in progress, ask an open question, ask for
collaborators, announce recently completed work that you would like to discuss
in-depth offline, etc.

Schedule
--------

- Tuesday, Feb. 7th

  `Luca Trevisan <https://people.eecs.berkeley.edu/~luca/>`_:
  Fundamental Techniques in Pseudorandomness V (Samplers)

  This is a continuation of Luca's mini-course at the recent Boot Camp,
  and covers the topic of "Samplers" which was omitted from the original
  sequence of lectures due to lack of time.

  **Lightning talk:**  `Arnab Bhattacharyya <http://drona.csa.iisc.ernet.in/~arnabb/>`_
  will present "Improved bounds for universal one-bit compressed sensing."

- Tuesday, Feb. 14th

  `Avi Wigderson <http://www.math.ias.edu/avi/home>`_
  "A gentle introduction to Brascamp-Lieb inequalities, and why I like them"

  It is based on a STOC'17 paper below (title & abstract below).

  Algorithmic and optimization aspects of Brascamp-Lieb inequalities, via Operator Scaling
  
  Ankit Garg, Leonid Gurvits, Rafael Olivera  and Avi Wigderson
  
  Abstract:
  
  The celebrated Brascamp-Lieb (BL) inequalities [BL76,Lieb90], and their reverse
  form of Barthe [Barthe2], are an important mathematical tool, unifying and
  generalizing numerous inequalities in analysis, convex geometry and information
  theory, with many used in computer science. While their structural theory is
  very well understood, far less is known about computing their main parameters
  (which we later define below). Prior to this work, the best known algorithms
  for any of these optimization tasks required at least exponential time.  In
  this work, we give polynomial time algorithms to compute:
  
  
  (1) Feasibility of BL-datum,
  (2) Optimal BL-constant,
  (3) Weak separation oracle for BL-polytopes.
  
  
  What is particularly exciting about this progress, beyond the better
  understanding of BL-inequalities, is that the objects above naturally encode
  rich families of optimization problems which had no prior efficient algorithms.
  In particular, the BL-constants (which we efficiently compute) are solutions to
  non-convex optimization problems, and the BL-polytopes (for which we provide
  efficient membership and separation oracles)  are linear programs with
  exponentially many facets. Thus we hope that new combinatorial optimization
  problems can be solved via reductions to the ones above, and make modest
  initial steps in exploring this possibility.
  
  Our algorithms are obtained by a simple efficient reduction of a given BL-datum
  to an instance of the Operator Scaling problem defined by [Gurvits2004]. To
  obtain the results above, we utilize the two (very recent and different)
  algorithms for the operator scaling problem [GGOW, IQS15b].  Our reduction
  implies algorithmic versions of many of the known structural results on
  BL-inequalities, and in some cases provide proofs that are different or simpler
  than existing ones. Further, the analytic properties of the [GGOW] algorithm
  provide new, effective bounds on the magnitude and continuity of BL-constants,
  with applications to non-linear versions of BL-inequalities; prior work relied
  on compactness, and thus provided no bounds.
  
  On a higher level, our application of operator scaling algorithm to
  BL-inequalities further connects analysis and optimization with the diverse
  mathematical areas used so far to motivate and solve the operator scaling
  problem, which include commutative invariant theory, non-commutative algebra,
  computational complexity and quantum information theory.
