If no one contacts them, they will contact you!  

Talks

We are soliciting one 45 minute talk each week.

Lightning Talks

We are soliciting two "lightning talks" per week.
These slots will be limited to five minutes, but otherwise quite informal.

collaborators, announce recently completed work that you would like to discuss
in-depth offline, etc.
