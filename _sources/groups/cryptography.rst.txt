Cryptography using Weak Sources of Randomness
============================================

This is a vast topic. You can see some videos of relevant topics here (including 4 hours of my lectures):
http://eventum.upf.edu/5484/videos/cost-iacr-school-on-randomness-in-cryptography.html

Briefly, I would like to cover the following areas (order might change depending on preferences):

#. Key Derivation vs. Randomness extraction (improved entropy loss for deriving cryptographic keys).
   This could be used as "extractors/PRGs fooling cryptographic security games". Should connect well with
   Luca's tutorial.

#. Impossibility of Cryptography with Weak Randomness (includes some fun open questions about
   randomness extraction from Bitcoin :)).

#. Privacy amplification. Will include topics such as non-malleable codes. I will give some intro, and Xin
   or David can comment about state-of-the-art

#. Extractors with special properties (local computability, error-correction, authentication, invertibility).

#. Random Oracle with Auxiliary input and Extractors. New stuff (upcoming Eurocrypt paper).

#. Entropy estimation, entropy accumulation and RNGs---huge challenge where our input is needed.

#. Improved Computational Extractors and Dense model theorem.

I plan to do this Mon-Thu February 6-9. Flexible about the time, except Monday will have to be after lunch.
Probably need at least 2 hours a day, but probably less than 3. We will unlikely cover all the topics, but can start.
And, if there is interest, we can continue starting March 6.

Feel free to email to me if you are interested to attend all/most days, or with any comments you have.
Thanks,
Yevgeniy
