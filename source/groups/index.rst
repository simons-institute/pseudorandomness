Groups
======

We decided to try to have several short-term reading groups, rather than a few spread out ones.  


Cryptography using Weak Sources of Randomness
---------------------------------------------

Yevgeniy Dodis will lead a working group on "Cryptography using Weak Sources
of Randomness" in early Feb.

Learning to Model Structures
----------------------------

Russell Impagliazzo will lead a group on "Learning to
Model Structures", about connections between boosting, dense model theorems
and regularity lemmas, probably in mid Feb.


Other topics will follow.
