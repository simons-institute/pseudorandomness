Pseudorandomness Seminar
========================

We meet 4:30--5:30 in room 116.


Tuesday, Feb. 7th
-----------------

`Luca Trevisan <https://people.eecs.berkeley.edu/~luca/>`_:
Fundamental Techniques in Pseudorandomness V (Samplers)

This is a continuation of Luca's mini-course at the recent Boot Camp,
and covers the topic of "Samplers" which was omitted from the original
sequence of lectures due to lack of time.

*Lightning talk.*  `Arnab Bhattacharyya <http://drona.csa.iisc.ernet.in/~arnabb/>`_
will present "Improved bounds for universal one-bit compressed sensing."

"A gentle introduction to Brascamp--Lieb inequalities, and why I like them"

The celebrated Brascamp--Lieb (BL) inequalities  are an important mathematical
tool, unifying and generalizing numerous inequalities in analysis, convex
geometry and information theory, with many used in computer science. While
their structural theory is very well understood, far less is known about
computing their main parameters. Prior to this work, the best known
algorithms for any of these optimization tasks required at least exponential
time. In this work, we give polynomial time algorithms to compute them. In
particular, these efficiently solve a large family of linear programs with
exponentially many facets, something which can be used for combinatorial
optimization. Both algorithms and analysis rely on our previous Operator
Scaling algorithm, and combine interesting math from several diverse fields.
However, no prior knowledge will be assumed for this talk.

Joint work with Ankit Garg, Leonid Gurvits and Rafael Olivera

Manuel Sabin (UC Berkeley)
"Average-Case Fine-Grained Hardness"

We present functions that are hard to compute on average for algorithms running
in some fixed polynomial time, assuming widely-conjectured worst-case hardness
for Orthogonal Vectors (OV), 3SUM, and All-Pairs Shortest Paths (APSP). Using
the same techniques we also obtain a conditional average-case time hierarchy of
functions.

Based on the average-case hardness and the algebraic structure we achieve for
our functions, we outline the construction of a Proof of Work scheme and
discuss possible approaches to constructing fine-grained One-Way Functions. We
also show how our reductions make conjectures regarding the worst-case hardness
of the problems we reduce from (and consequently the Strong Exponential Time
Hypothesis) heuristically falsifiable in a sense similar to that of (Naor,
CRYPTO 2003).

We will discuss many open problems that these results reveal, including
pseudorandomness and derandomization in the fine-grained world.

Joint with Marshall Ball, Alon Rosen, and Prashant Nalini Vasudevan.

*Lightning talk.* Dean Doron (Tel Aviv University) will present recent work on solving
Lapalcian systems in probabilistic logspace.

`Daniel Kane <https://cseweb.ucsd.edu/~dakane/>`_
"Fooling Fourier Shapes"

We present recent work providing a nearly optimal, explicit
pseudorandom generator against linear threshold functions. The basic
idea is to fool the Fourier transform of the corresponding linear
forms rather than the threshold function. This generalizes further to
fooling a class of functions that we call "Fourier shapes". We discuss
the generator and some of its applications.

*Lightning talk.* Pierre Bienvenu (University of Bristol) will present problems
of arithmetic combinatorics in Function fields and possible use of the polynomial method to attack them.
