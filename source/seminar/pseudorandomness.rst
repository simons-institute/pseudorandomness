Pseudorandomness Seminar
========================

The main Pseudorandomness Seminar will be Tuesdays, 4:30-5:30 in room 116 of
Calvin Lab.
We will adjourn to a pub of some kind afterwards.
The co-ordinators are `Marco Carmosino <http://marco.ntime.org/>`_ and
`Jarrod Millman <http://www.jarrodmillman.com/>`_.

Call for Talks
--------------

If you would like one of these slots, please send a request and title to Marco
or Jarrod.
Please make sure to specify whether you would like a regular or lightning talk.
If no one contacts them, they will contact you!  

Talks
~~~~~

We are soliciting one 45 minute talk each week.

Lightning Talks
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

We are soliciting two "lightning talks" per week.
These slots will be limited to five minutes, but otherwise quite informal.
Use them to announce work in progress, ask an open question, ask for
collaborators, announce recently completed work that you would like to discuss
in-depth offline, etc.

Schedule
--------

- Tuesday, Feb. 7th

  `Luca Trevisan <https://people.eecs.berkeley.edu/~luca/>`_:
  Fundamental Techniques in Pseudorandomness V (Samplers)

  This is a continuation of Luca's mini-course at the recent Boot Camp,
  and covers the topic of "Samplers" which was omitted from the original
  sequence of lectures due to lack of time.

  **Lightning talk:**  `Arnab Bhattacharyya <http://drona.csa.iisc.ernet.in/~arnabb/>`_
  will present "Improved bounds for universal one-bit compressed sensing."

- Tuesday, Feb. 14th

  `Avi Wigderson <http://www.math.ias.edu/avi/home>`_
  "A gentle introduction to Brascamp--Lieb inequalities, and why I like them"

  The celebrated Brascamp--Lieb (BL) inequalities  are an important mathematical
  tool, unifying and generalizing numerous inequalities in analysis, convex
  geometry and information theory, with many used in computer science. While
  their structural theory is very well understood, far less is known about
  computing their main parameters. Prior to this work, the best known
  algorithms for any of these optimization tasks required at least exponential
  time. In this work, we give polynomial time algorithms to compute them. In
  particular, these efficiently solve a large family of linear programs with
  exponentially many facets, something which can be used for combinatorial
  optimization. Both algorithms and analysis rely on our previous Operator
  Scaling algorithm, and combine interesting math from several diverse fields.
  However, no prior knowledge will be assumed for this talk.

  Joint work with Ankit Garg, Leonid Gurvits and Rafael Olivera

- Tuesday, Feb. 21th

  Manuel Sabin (UC Berkeley)
  "Average-Case Fine-Grained Hardness"

  We present functions that are hard to compute on average for algorithms running
  in some fixed polynomial time, assuming widely-conjectured worst-case hardness
  for Orthogonal Vectors (OV), 3SUM, and All-Pairs Shortest Paths (APSP). Using
  the same techniques we also obtain a conditional average-case time hierarchy of
  functions.
  
  Based on the average-case hardness and the algebraic structure we achieve for
  our functions, we outline the construction of a Proof of Work scheme and
  discuss possible approaches to constructing fine-grained One-Way Functions. We
  also show how our reductions make conjectures regarding the worst-case hardness
  of the problems we reduce from (and consequently the Strong Exponential Time
  Hypothesis) heuristically falsifiable in a sense similar to that of (Naor,
  CRYPTO 2003).
  
  We will discuss many open problems that these results reveal, including
  pseudorandomness and derandomization in the fine-grained world.
