Pseudorandomness Seminar
========================

The main Pseudorandomness Seminar will be Tuesdays, 4:30-5:30 in room 116 of
Calvin Lab (and perhaps a bit later if the situation requires it).
We will adjourn to a pub of some kind afterwards.
The first seminar will be Feb. 7,  after next week's workshop is over.
The co-ordinators are `Marco Carmosino <http://marco.ntime.org/>`_ and
`Jarrod Millman <http://www.jarrodmillman.com/>`_.

Talk Solicitation
-----------------

Please contact Marco if you are interested in speaking, or will have a
visitor interested in speaking.
If no one contacts them, they will contact you!  

Lightning Talk Solicitation
---------------------------

The pseudorandomness program should have a semi-formal way to announce work in
progress and preliminary results. But there is a rich abundance of scheduled
activities this semester, so it does not make sense to have an hour-long
seminar devoted to preliminary work. Instead, we are soliciting two five-minute
"lightning talks" per week, to immediately follow the main Pseudorandomness
Seminar talk. These slots will be limited to five minutes, but otherwise quite
informal. Use them to announce work in progress, ask an open question, ask for
collaborators, announce recently completed work that you would like to discuss
in-depth offline, etc. If you would like one of these slots, please send a
request and title to Marco or Jarrod, who are organizing the Pseudorandomness
Seminar.
