Pseudorandomness Seminar
========================

The main Pseudorandomness Seminar will be Tuesdays, 4:30-5:30 in room 116 of Calvin Lab (and perhaps a bit later if the situation requires it).
We will adjourn to a pub of some kind afterwards.
The first seminar will be Feb. 7,  after next week's workshop is over.
The co-ordinators are Marco Carmosino and Jarrod Millman.
Please contact Marco if you are interested in speaking, or will have a visitor interested in speaking.
If no one contacts them, they will contact you!
