<p><strong>Partial Steiner systems of large girth, Nati Linial</strong></p>
<p>Let us first recall that the <em>girth</em> of a graph <span class="math">\(G\)</span> is the least integer
<span class="math">\(g\)</span> such that there is a set of <span class="math">\(g\)</span> vertices in <span class="math">\(G\)</span> that spans at least <span class="math">\(g\)</span>
edges. We seek an analogous notion for 3-uniform hypergraphs. In fact we
only deal with <em>linear</em> hypergraphs <span class="math">\(H\)</span> where every two hyperedges share
at most one vertex. As defined by Erdős, the girth of <span class="math">\(H\)</span> is the
smallest integer <span class="math">\(g\ge 4\)</span> such that there is a set of <span class="math">\(g\)</span> vertices in <span class="math">\(H\)</span>
that spans at least <span class="math">\(g-2\)</span> hyperedges. He conjectured that there exist
Steiner Triple Systems with arbitrarily high girth, but despite considerable
attempts over the years, the state of our knowledge concerning this problem
is quite bad. I therefore formulate a variant that may be more accessible:</p>
<p>Question: Does there exist <span class="math">\(c&gt;0\)</span> and <span class="math">\(n\)</span>-vertex <span class="math">\(3\)</span>-uniform hypergraphs with
at least <span class="math">\(cn^2\)</span> hyperedges and arbitrarily high girth?</p>
<p><strong>Cliques in near Ramanujan Graphs, Noga Alon</strong></p>
<p>An <span class="math">\((n,d, \lambda)\)</span>-graph is a <span class="math">\(d\)</span>-regular graph on <span class="math">\(n\)</span> vertices so
that all eigenvalues but the top one are in absolute value at most
<span class="math">\(\lambda\)</span>. Let <span class="math">\(G\)</span> be an <span class="math">\((n,d,100\sqrt d)\)</span>-graph. It is known that:</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li>There is a constant <span class="math">\(c&gt;0\)</span> so that if <span class="math">\(d \geq cn^{2/3}\)</span> then <span class="math">\(G\)</span>
contains a triangle.</li>
<li>The statement in (i) is tight up to the constant  <span class="math">\(c\)</span>.</li>
<li>There is a constant <span class="math">\(c&gt;0\)</span> so that if <span class="math">\(d \geq cn^{4/5}\)</span> then
<span class="math">\(G\)</span> contains a copy of <span class="math">\(K_4\)</span>.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Open:</strong>
Is (3) tight up to the value of <span class="math">\(c\)</span>?
That is, is there an <span class="math">\((n,d,100\sqrt d)\)</span>-graph containing no <span class="math">\(K_4\)</span>, where
<span class="math">\(d =\Omega(n^{4/5})\)</span>?
It is not even known whether or not there is such a graph with <span class="math">\(n^{2/3} =o(d)\)</span>.</p>
<p><strong>On the extractable entropy from zero-fixing sources, Gil Cohen</strong></p>
<p>Let <span class="math">\(n \ge k \ge 0\)</span> be integers. An <span class="math">\(n\)</span>-bit random variable <span class="math">\(X\)</span> is called
a <span class="math">\(k\)</span>-<em>zero-fixing source</em> if there exists a subset of indices
<span class="math">\(R \subseteq [n]\)</span> such that the marginal of <span class="math">\(X\)</span> when projected to <span class="math">\(R\)</span>
is uniformly distributed, and the remaining bits of <span class="math">\(X\)</span> are fixed to
zero. The parameter <span class="math">\(k\)</span> is called the entropy of <span class="math">\(X\)</span>. Let <span class="math">\(m = m(n,k)\)</span>
be the largest integer for which there exists a function
<span class="math">\(\mathsf{Ext}_k : \{ 0,1 \}^n \to \{0,1\}^m\)</span>
with the following property: for any
<span class="math">\(k\)</span>-zero-fixing source <span class="math">\(X\)</span>, <span class="math">\(\mathsf{Ext}_k(X)\)</span> is within statistical
distance <span class="math">\(1/5\)</span> from uniform (here <span class="math">\(1/5\)</span> is an arbitrary choice of a small
constant.) We stress that <span class="math">\(\mathsf{Ext}_k\)</span> does not get the description
of the source <span class="math">\(X\)</span> (namely, the set <span class="math">\(R\)</span>) but rather a single sample from
<span class="math">\(X\)</span>. Such a function <span class="math">\(\mathsf{Ext}_k\)</span> is called an
<em>extractor for</em> <span class="math">\(k\)</span>-<em>zero-fixing sources</em>. We would like to have a better understanding
of the function <span class="math">\(m(n,k)\)</span> that, informally speaking, captures the
amount of extractable entropy from zero-fixing sources. Clearly,
<span class="math">\(m(n,k) \le k\)</span>. By a straightforward counting argument, for any <span class="math">\(k &gt;
\log_2\log{n} + \log_2\log\log{n}+\Omega(1)\)</span>, <span class="math">\(m(n,k) = k - O(1)\)</span>. That
is, when the entropy <span class="math">\(k\)</span> is high enough, one can extract essentially
all the entropy from the source. What about smaller entropies? For any
<span class="math">\(k\)</span>, <span class="math">\(m(n,k) \ge 0.5 \log_2{k} - O(1)\)</span> as can be seen by considering
the function that takes the Hamming weight of the input <span class="math">\(X\)</span> modulo
<span class="math">\(\Theta(\sqrt{k})\)</span> <a class="reference internal" href="../references.html#kamp2006deterministic" id="id1">[KZ06]</a><a class="reference internal" href="../references.html#reshef2013extractors" id="id2">[RV13]</a>. That is to say, a logarithmic amount
of entropy is always extractable. Interestingly, this simple function is
optimal for small enough <span class="math">\(k\)</span>. Put formally, <span class="math">\(m(n,(\log^{\ast}{n})^{2/3})
\le 0.5 \log_2{k} + O(1)\)</span> <a class="reference internal" href="../references.html#cohen2015zero" id="id3">[CS15]</a>. The natural open problem is
to understand the behavior of <span class="math">\(m(n,k)\)</span> and close the gap between <span class="math">\(k =
\Omega(\log\log{n})\)</span> and <span class="math">\(k = O((\log^{\ast}{n})^{2/3})\)</span>. In particular,
it is not clear if <span class="math">\(m(n,k)\)</span> has a threshold behavior, namely, if there
exists a function <span class="math">\(\tau(n)\)</span> such that for <span class="math">\(k = \omega(\tau(n))\)</span>,
<span class="math">\(m(n,k)
= k - O(1)\)</span> whereas for <span class="math">\(k = o(\tau(n))\)</span>, <span class="math">\(m(n,k) \le 0.5 \log_2{k} + O(1)\)</span>.</p>
<p><strong>Beating the expander mixing lemma for small sets, David Zuckerman</strong></p>
<p>The expander mixing lemma asserts that in a <span class="math">\(d\)</span>-regular
graph <span class="math">\(G\)</span> on <span class="math">\(n\)</span> nodes,
for sets <span class="math">\(S\)</span> and <span class="math">\(T\)</span> of size <span class="math">\(k\)</span>, we have</p>
<div class="math">
\[| e(S,T) - dk^2/n | &lt; \lambda k,\]</div>
<p>where <span class="math">\(\lambda = \max(\lambda_2,-\lambda_n)\)</span> is the largest
nontrivial eigenvalue in absolute value.
Even for optimal <span class="math">\(\lambda = O(\sqrt{d})\)</span>, this is
useless when <span class="math">\(k &lt; c\sqrt{n}\)</span>.
On the other hand, when <span class="math">\(d&gt;(n/k)\log(n/k)\)</span>, most <span class="math">\(d\)</span>-regular
graphs achieve an upper bound of <span class="math">\(O(k\sqrt{(dk/n)\log(n/k)})\)</span>.
This is better than the expander mixing lemma for <span class="math">\(k=o(n)\)</span>.</p>
<p>The problem is to give an upper bound <span class="math">\(f(G,k)\)</span>
that is better than <span class="math">\(\lambda k\)</span> for some interesting graphs
or for most or even many graphs.
For dense graphs, this corresponds to two-source extractors.
Bounds on line-point incidence graphs are also known.
It would be extremely interesting to have a general method.</p>
<p><strong>Spectral radius problem for free groups, Emmanuel Breuillard</strong></p>
<p>If <span class="math">\(\mu\)</span> is a probability measure on a non-abelian free
group <span class="math">\(F\)</span>, let <span class="math">\(\sigma(\mu):=\|T_\mu\|\)</span> be the norm of the
convolution operator on <span class="math">\(\ell^2(F)\)</span></p>
<div class="math">
\[T_\mu: f \mapsto \mu * f,\]</div>
<p>where <span class="math">\(\mu*f (x) = \sum_{g \in G} f(g^{-1}x)\mu(x)\)</span>.</p>
<p>Is it true that for every <span class="math">\(\epsilon&gt;0\)</span> there is
<span class="math">\(\delta&gt;0\)</span>  such that for all probability measures <span class="math">\(\mu\)</span> on <span class="math">\(F\)</span>,
the condition <span class="math">\(\sigma(\mu)&gt;\epsilon\)</span> implies that there is a
coset <span class="math">\(xH\)</span> of a cyclic subgroup <span class="math">\(H\)</span> of <span class="math">\(F\)</span> such that
<span class="math">\(\mu(xH)&gt;\delta\)</span>?</p>
<p><strong>Explicit Coding Power Series, Anup Rao</strong></p>
<p>We are interested in giving an explicit description of a formal
power-series over a finite field <span class="math">\(F\)</span> with some nice properties. The
motivation comes from several applications related to coding.</p>
<p>We say that a power series <span class="math">\(P(X) = p_0 + p_1 X + \ldots\)</span>
is
<span class="math">\(\epsilon\)</span>-<em>sparse</em> if there is a finite <span class="math">\(k\)</span> such that of the first
<span class="math">\(k\)</span>
coefficients of <span class="math">\(P(X)\)</span>, at most <span class="math">\(\epsilon k\)</span> of them are non-zero.</p>
<p>Definition: <span class="math">\(P(X)\)</span> is an <span class="math">\(\epsilon\)</span>-<em>coding power series</em> if for every
polynomial <span class="math">\(g(X)\)</span> with <span class="math">\(0/1\)</span> coefficients, the power series
<span class="math">\((1+ Xg(X))P(X)\)</span> is not <span class="math">\(\epsilon\)</span>-sparse.</p>
<p>Fact: For every <span class="math">\(\epsilon &gt;0 \)</span>, there is a finite field <span class="math">\(F\)</span>
for which a random
power series <span class="math">\(P(X)\)</span> will be a coding power series with positive
probability.</p>
<p>Open Problem: Give an explicit example of a coding power-series.</p>
